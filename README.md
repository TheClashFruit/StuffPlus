CurseForge: coming soon...

Addition blocks that I think is missing from the game.

----

Currently, only adds bookshelves for different types of wood, and I'm working on adding more things that are missing. Even tho it's called Blocks+, I plan on adding items too.

If you have a suggestion open an issue on GitHub with the enhancement label.
